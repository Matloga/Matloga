Hi, Iâ€™m Matloga Tsumbedzo!

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm excited to share my journey in the world of software development, with a particular focus on Java Full-Stack development.

About Me
I'm passionate about coding and technology. My primary interest lies in Java, where I am delving into both front-end and back-end development. Mastering the full stack allows me to understand and contribute to all aspects of an application.

Current Learning Journey
Currently, I am honing my skills in:
- Java Basics: Understanding core concepts and object-oriented programming.
- Spring Framework: Exploring Spring Boot and building RESTful services.
- Front-End Technologies: Learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create dynamic user interfaces.
- Databases: Gaining knowledge in SQL and ORM tools like Hibernate.

Projects
I enjoy working on projects that challenge my skills and enhance my learning. Some of my current and upcoming projects include:
- A personal blog application with user authentication.
- An e-commerce platform using Spring Boot and React.
- A real-time chat application to practice WebSocket integration.
